### Formatting
To prevent any unwanted XSS vulerability, jQuery Terminal provide it's own
simple markup, which in rest of the documentat is called formatting.

You can echo jQuery object

### anyLinks

Links and XSS to prevent any XSS by default jQuery Terminal block any non http protocols
Like `javascript:`. You can enable that if you want but you should make sure that
you don't echo stuff from users and expose expose those stuff to other users.
(As in Persitent XSS and Reflected XSS). If you enable option anyLinks you're
resposible of any Security issues you may have.




### renderHandler

With renderHandler you can render any objects you want and you provide a function
that tell jQuery Terminal how to handle each type. When you've rendered the content
you should return false to prevent double rendering.

So render handler is pretty powerfull, if you think that jQuery Terminal formatting
is not needed because you can do everything in renderHandler, then you're right.
RenderHandler is new API that allow to do stuff that jQuery Formatting can't do.
But formatter fit better into terminal, it allow to wrap text properly
(wrap by words or wrap by characters).
