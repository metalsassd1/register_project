[[b;#fff;]DESCRIPTION]
       [[b;#fff;]man]  is  the system's manual pager.  Each [[u;;]page] argument given to [[b;#fff;]man] is normally the name of a program,
       utility or function.  The [[u;;]manual] [[u;;]page] associated with each of these arguments is then  found  and  dis-
       played.   A  [[u;;]section], if provided, will direct [[b;#fff;]man] to look only in that [[u;;]section] of the manual.  The de-
       fault action is to search in all of the available [[u;;]sections]  following  a  pre-defined  order  (see  [[b;#fff;]DE-]
       [[b;#fff;]FAULTS]), and to show only the first [[u;;]page] found, even if [[u;;]page] exists in several [[u;;]sections].

       The table below shows the [[u;;]section] numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in [[u;;]/dev])
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. [[u;;]/etc/passwd]
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. [[b;#fff;]man](7), [[b;#fff;]groff](7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual [[u;;]page] consists of several sections.

       Conventional  section  names  include [[b;#fff;]NAME], [[b;#fff;]SYNOPSIS], [[b;#fff;]CONFIGURATION], [[b;#fff;]DESCRIPTION], [[b;#fff;]OPTIONS], [[b;#fff;]EXIT] [[b;#fff;]STATUS],
       [[b;#fff;]RETURN] [[b;#fff;]VALUE], [[b;#fff;]ERRORS], [[b;#fff;]ENVIRONMENT], [[b;#fff;]FILES], [[b;#fff;]VERSIONS], [[b;#fff;]CONFORMING] [[b;#fff;]TO], [[b;#fff;]NOTES], [[b;#fff;]BUGS], [[b;#fff;]EXAMPLE],  [[b;#fff;]AUTHORS],  and
       [[b;#fff;]SEE] [[b;#fff;]ALSO].

       The following conventions apply to the [[b;#fff;]SYNOPSIS] section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       [[b;#fff;]bold] [[b;#fff;]text]          type exactly as shown.
       [[u;;]italic] [[u;;]text]        replace with appropriate argument.
       [[[b;#fff;]-abc]]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       [[b;#fff;]-a]|[[b;#fff;]-b]              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       [[u;;]argument] ...       [[u;;]argument] is repeatable.
       [[[u;;]expression]] ...   entire [[u;;]expression] within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to
       render italics when running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In  some
       cases  it  is advisable to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the [[b;#fff;]SYNOPSIS] section
       of this manual page.

[[b;#fff;]EXAMPLES]
       [[b;#fff;]man] [[u;;]ls]
           Display the manual page for the [[u;;]item] (program) [[u;;]ls].

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[u;;]man].[[u;;]7]
           Display the manual page for macro package [[u;;]man] from section [[u;;]7].  (This is an alternative spelling  of
           "[[b;#fff;]man] [[u;;]7] [[u;;]man]".)

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]'][[u;;]man]([[u;;]7])'
           Display  the manual page for macro package [[u;;]man] from section [[u;;]7].  (This is another alternative spell-
           ing of "[[b;#fff;]man] [[u;;]7] [[u;;]man]".  It may be more convenient when copying and pasting cross-references to  manual
           pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]-a] [[u;;]intro]
           Display, in succession, all of the available [[u;;]intro] manual pages contained within the manual.  It is
           possible to quit between successive displays or skip any of them.

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]-t] [[u;;]bash] | [[u;;]lpr] [[u;;]-Pps]
           Format the manual page for [[u;;]bash] into the default [[b;#fff;]troff] or [[b;#fff;]groff] format and pipe it to  the  printer
           named  [[u;;]ps].   The  default  output  for [[b;#fff;]groff] is usually PostScript.  [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]--help] should advise as to
           which processor is bound to the [[b;#fff;]-t] option.

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]-l] [[b;#fff;]-T][[u;;]dvi] [[u;;]./foo.1x.gz] [[b;#fff;]>] [[u;;]./foo.1x.dvi]
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page [[u;;]./foo.1x.gz] into a [[b;#fff;]device]  [[b;#fff;]in-]
           [[b;#fff;]dependent]  [[b;#fff;](dvi)] file.  The redirection is necessary as the [[b;#fff;]-T] flag causes output to be directed to
           [[b;#fff;]stdout] with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as [[b;#fff;]xdvi] or further  processed
           into PostScript using a program such as [[b;#fff;]dvips].

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]-k] [[u;;]printf]
           Search  the  short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword [[u;;]printf] as regular expression.
           Print out any matches.  Equivalent to [[b;#fff;]apropos] [[u;;]printf][[b;#fff;].]

       [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]-f] [[u;;]smail]
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by [[u;;]smail] and print out the  short  descriptions  of  any  found.
           Equivalent to [[b;#fff;]whatis] [[u;;]smail][[b;#fff;].]

[[b;#fff;]OVERVIEW]
       Many  options  are  available  to  [[b;#fff;]man]  in  order  to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.
       Changes can be made to the search path, section order, output processor, and other behaviours and oper-
       ations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of [[b;#fff;]man].  It is possi-
       ble to set the "catch-all" variable $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT] to any string in command line format,  with  the  exception
       that  any  spaces  used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  [[b;#fff;]man]
       will parse $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT] prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will  be
       overridden  by the same options found on the command line.  To reset all of the options set in $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT],
       [[b;#fff;]-D] can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the  op-
       tions specified in $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT], although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages are normally stored in [[b;#fff;]nroff](1) format under a directory such as [[u;;]/usr/share/man].  In some
       installations, there may also be preformatted [[u;;]cat] [[u;;]pages] to improve performance.  See [[b;#fff;]manpath](5) for de-
       tails of where these files are stored.

       This  package  supports  manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your [[u;;]locale].  If your system
       did not set this up for you automatically, then you may need to set  $[[b;#fff;]LC_MESSAGES],  $[[b;#fff;]LANG],  or  another
       system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the [[b;#fff;]POSIX]
       format:

       <[[u;;]language]>[[[b;#fff;]_]<[[u;;]territory]>[[[b;#fff;].]<[[u;;]character-set]>[[[b;#fff;],]<[[u;;]version]>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your [[u;;]locale], it will be displayed in lieu of the standard  (usually
       American English) page.

       If  you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language
       and you would like to supply them, please contact the maintainer who will be coordinating  such  activ-
       ity.

       Individual  manual  pages  are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, func-
       tion, or other topic that they document, and are not included with this package.  If you  find  that  a
       manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For  information  regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read
       the documents supplied with the package.

[[b;#fff;]DEFAULTS]
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $[[b;#fff;]MANSECT] or by  the  [[b;#fff;]SEC-]
       [[b;#fff;]TION] directive in [[u;;]/etc/man][[b;#fff;]_][[u;;]db.conf].  By default it is as follows:

              1 1p 8 2 3 3p 3pm 4 5 6 7 9 0p n l p o 1x 2x 3x 4x 5x 6x 7x 8x

       The  formatted  manual  page is displayed using a [[u;;]pager].  This can be specified in a number of ways, or
       else will fall back to a default (see option [[b;#fff;]-P] for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option [[b;#fff;]-p] or  the  environ-
       ment  variable  $[[b;#fff;]MANROFFSEQ]  is  interrogated.  If [[b;#fff;]-p] was not used and the environment variable was not
       set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a  valid  pre-
       processor string, the first line must resemble

       [[b;#fff;]'\"] <[[b;#fff;]string]>

       where [[b;#fff;]string] can be any combination of letters described by option [[b;#fff;]-p] below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter ([[b;#fff;]nroff] or [[[b;#fff;]tg]][[b;#fff;]roff] with [[b;#fff;]-t])
       and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable program [[u;;]mandb][[b;#fff;]_][[u;;]nfmt] (or [[u;;]mandb][[b;#fff;]_][[u;;]tfmt] with [[b;#fff;]-t]) exists in the
       man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string,
       and optionally the device specified with [[b;#fff;]-T] or [[b;#fff;]-E] as arguments.

[[b;#fff;]OPTIONS]
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT], or both, are not harm-
       ful.  For options that require an argument, each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   [[b;#fff;]General] [[b;#fff;]options]
       [[b;#fff;]-C] [[u;;]file], [[b;#fff;]--config-file=][[u;;]file]
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of [[u;;]~/.manpath].

       [[b;#fff;]-d], [[b;#fff;]--debug]
              Print debugging information.

       [[b;#fff;]-D], [[b;#fff;]--default]
              This  option  is  normally issued as the very first option and resets [[b;#fff;]man's] behaviour to its de-
              fault.  Its use is to reset those options that may have been set in $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT].  Any  options  that
              follow [[b;#fff;]-D] will have their usual effect.

       [[b;#fff;]--warnings][=[[u;;]warnings]]
              Enable  warnings  from  [[u;;]groff].   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of
              manual pages.  [[u;;]warnings] is a comma-separated list of warning names; if it is not  supplied,  the
              default is "mac".  See the "Warnings" node in [[b;#fff;]info] [[b;#fff;]groff] for a list of available warning names.

   [[b;#fff;]Main] [[b;#fff;]modes] [[b;#fff;]of] [[b;#fff;]operation]
       [[b;#fff;]-f], [[b;#fff;]--whatis]
              Equivalent  to  [[b;#fff;]whatis].   Display  a  short description from the manual page, if available.  See
              [[b;#fff;]whatis](1) for details.

       [[b;#fff;]-k], [[b;#fff;]--apropos]
              Equivalent to [[b;#fff;]apropos].  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and  display  any
              matches.  See [[b;#fff;]apropos](1) for details.

       [[b;#fff;]-K], [[b;#fff;]--global-apropos]
              Search  for  text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some
              time; if you can, you should specify a section to reduce the number of pages  that  need  to  be
              searched.   Search  terms  may  be  simple  strings (the default), or regular expressions if the
              [[b;#fff;]--regex] option is used.

              Note that this searches the [[u;;]sources] of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so  may  in-
              clude  false positives due to things like comments in source files.  Searching the rendered text
              would be much slower.

       [[b;#fff;]-l], [[b;#fff;]--local-file]
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching  through  the
              system's  manual  collection.   Each manual page argument will be interpreted as an nroff source
              file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments,
              input  will  be  taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page
              required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as if  this  option  was  sup-
              plied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       [[b;#fff;]-w], [[b;#fff;]--where], [[b;#fff;]--path], [[b;#fff;]--location]
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that
              would be formatted.  If the [[b;#fff;]-a] option is also used, then print the locations of all source files
              that match the search criteria.

       [[b;#fff;]-W], [[b;#fff;]--where-cat], [[b;#fff;]--location-cat]
              Don't  actually  display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file
              that would be displayed.  If the [[b;#fff;]-a] option is also used, then print the locations of all prefor-
              matted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  [[b;#fff;]-w]  and [[b;#fff;]-W] are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If
              all of [[b;#fff;]-w], [[b;#fff;]-W], and [[b;#fff;]-a] are used, then do this for each possible match.

       [[b;#fff;]-c], [[b;#fff;]--catman]
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the [[b;#fff;]catman] program.

       [[b;#fff;]-R] [[u;;]encoding], [[b;#fff;]--recode]=[[u;;]encoding]
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the spec-
              ified  [[u;;]encoding].   If  you  already  know the encoding of the source file, you can also use [[b;#fff;]man-]
              [[b;#fff;]conv](1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to  a  single
              encoding  without  having  to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were al-
              ready installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider using [[b;#fff;]man-recode](1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has  an  in-
              terface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much faster.

   [[b;#fff;]Finding] [[b;#fff;]manual] [[b;#fff;]pages]
       [[b;#fff;]-L] [[u;;]locale], [[b;#fff;]--locale=][[u;;]locale]
              [[b;#fff;]man]  will  normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function [[b;#fff;]setlocale](3) which
              interrogates various environment variables, possibly including $[[b;#fff;]LC_MESSAGES] and $[[b;#fff;]LANG].  To  tem-
              porarily  override  the  determined value, use this option to supply a [[u;;]locale] string directly to
              [[b;#fff;]man].  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such
              as the help message will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

       [[b;#fff;]-m] [[u;;]system][,...], [[b;#fff;]--systems=][[u;;]system][,...]
              If  this  system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using
              this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's manual page collection, use the option [[b;#fff;]-m]
              [[b;#fff;]NewOS].

              The [[u;;]system] specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include
              a search of the native operating system's manual pages, include the system name [[b;#fff;]man] in the argu-
              ment string.  This option will override the $[[b;#fff;]SYSTEM] environment variable.

       [[b;#fff;]-M] [[u;;]path], [[b;#fff;]--manpath=][[u;;]path]
              Specify an alternate manpath to use.  By default, [[b;#fff;]man] uses [[b;#fff;]manpath] derived code to determine the
              path to search.  This option overrides the $[[b;#fff;]MANPATH] environment variable and causes option [[b;#fff;]-m] to
              be ignored.

              A  path  specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sec-
              tions as described in the man-db manual (under "The manual page system").  To view manual  pages
              outside such hierarchies, see the [[b;#fff;]-l] option.

       [[b;#fff;]-S] [[u;;]list], [[b;#fff;]-s] [[u;;]list], [[b;#fff;]--sections=][[u;;]list]
              The  given  [[u;;]list] is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual
              sections to search and in what order.  This option overrides the $[[b;#fff;]MANSECT] environment  variable.
              (The [[b;#fff;]-s] spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       [[b;#fff;]-e] [[u;;]sub-extension], [[b;#fff;]--extension=][[u;;]sub-extension]
              Some  systems  incorporate  large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the [[b;#fff;]Tcl]
              package, into the main manual page hierarchy.  To get around the problem of  having  two  manual
              pages  with the same name such as [[b;#fff;]exit](3), the [[b;#fff;]Tcl] pages were usually all assigned to section [[b;#fff;]l].
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and  to  as-
              sign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, [[b;#fff;]exit](3tcl).  Under normal operation, [[b;#fff;]man] will
              display [[b;#fff;]exit](3) in preference to [[b;#fff;]exit](3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to
              know  which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give [[b;#fff;]man] a [[u;;]sub-exten-]
              [[u;;]sion] string indicating which package the page must belong to.  Using the above example,  supply-
              ing the option [[b;#fff;]-e] [[b;#fff;]tcl] to [[b;#fff;]man] will restrict the search to pages having an extension of [[b;#fff;]*tcl].

       [[b;#fff;]-i], [[b;#fff;]--ignore-case]
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       [[b;#fff;]-I], [[b;#fff;]--match-case]
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       [[b;#fff;]--regex]
              Show  all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each [[u;;]page] ar-
              gument as a regular expression, as with [[b;#fff;]apropos](1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to
              pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies [[b;#fff;]-a].

       [[b;#fff;]--wildcard]
              Show  all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each [[u;;]page] ar-
              gument using shell-style wildcards, as with [[b;#fff;]apropos](1) [[b;#fff;]--wildcard].  The [[u;;]page] argument must match
              the  entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is
              usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this  option  im-
              plies [[b;#fff;]-a].

       [[b;#fff;]--names-only]
              If  the  [[b;#fff;]--regex]  or [[b;#fff;]--wildcard] option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as
              with [[b;#fff;]whatis](1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       [[b;#fff;]-a], [[b;#fff;]--all]
              By default, [[b;#fff;]man] will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.   Using  this
              option forces [[b;#fff;]man] to display all the manual pages with names that match the search criteria.

       [[b;#fff;]-u], [[b;#fff;]--update]
              This  option  causes  [[b;#fff;]man] to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only
              needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to run [[b;#fff;]mandb](8) instead.

       [[b;#fff;]--no-subpages]
              By default, [[b;#fff;]man] will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the  command  line  as
              equivalent to a single manual page name containing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the
              common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide man-
              ual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the sub-
              commands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the [[b;#fff;]--no-subpages] option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   [[b;#fff;]Controlling] [[b;#fff;]formatted] [[b;#fff;]output]
       [[b;#fff;]-P] [[u;;]pager], [[b;#fff;]--pager=][[u;;]pager]
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, [[b;#fff;]man] uses [[b;#fff;]less], falling back to [[b;#fff;]cat]  if  [[b;#fff;]less]  is
              not found or is not executable.  This option overrides the $[[b;#fff;]MANPAGER] environment variable, which
              in turn overrides the $[[b;#fff;]PAGER] environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with [[b;#fff;]-f] or [[b;#fff;]-k].

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may  use  shell  quoting
              (backslashes,  single  quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple com-
              mands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either  as  an
              argument or on standard input.

       [[b;#fff;]-r] [[u;;]prompt], [[b;#fff;]--prompt=][[u;;]prompt]
              If  a  recent  version of [[b;#fff;]less] is used as the pager, [[b;#fff;]man] will attempt to set its prompt and some
              sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               [[b;#fff;]Manual] [[b;#fff;]page] [[u;;]name][[b;#fff;](][[u;;]sec][[b;#fff;])] [[b;#fff;]line] [[u;;]x]

              where [[u;;]name] denotes the manual page name, [[u;;]sec] denotes the section it was found under  and  [[u;;]x]  the
              current line number.  This is achieved by using the $[[b;#fff;]LESS] environment variable.

              Supplying  [[b;#fff;]-r] with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text [[b;#fff;]$MAN_PN]
              which will be expanded to the name of the current manual page and its section name surrounded by
              "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              [[b;#fff;]\] [[b;#fff;]Manual\] [[b;#fff;]page\] [[b;#fff;]\$MAN_PN\] [[b;#fff;]?ltline\] [[b;#fff;]%lt?L/%L.:]
              [[b;#fff;]byte\] [[b;#fff;]%bB?s/%s..?\] [[b;#fff;](END):?pB\] [[b;#fff;]%pB\\%..]
              [[b;#fff;](press] [[b;#fff;]h] [[b;#fff;]for] [[b;#fff;]help] [[b;#fff;]or] [[b;#fff;]q] [[b;#fff;]to] [[b;#fff;]quit)]

              It  is  broken  into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the
              [[b;#fff;]less](1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evaluated by the  shell.   All  double  quotes,
              back-quotes  and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for  less.   By  default
              [[b;#fff;]man] sets the [[b;#fff;]-ix8] options.

              The  $[[b;#fff;]MANLESS] environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if
              none is supplied on the command line.

       [[b;#fff;]-7], [[b;#fff;]--ascii]
              When viewing a pure [[u;;]ascii](7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some  charac-
              ters may not display correctly when using the [[u;;]latin1](7) device description with [[b;#fff;]GNU] [[b;#fff;]nroff].  This
              option allows pure [[u;;]ascii] manual pages to be displayed in [[u;;]ascii] with the [[u;;]latin1] device.  It  will
              not translate any [[u;;]latin1] text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts
              of it may only be displayed properly when using [[b;#fff;]GNU] [[b;#fff;]nroff]'s [[u;;]latin1](7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ---------------------------------------------
              continuation hyphen    255      -        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      o        o+
              acute accent           264      '        '
              multiplication sign    327      x        x

              If the[[u;;] ]l[[u;;]atin1] column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for [[u;;]latin1]  characters  and
              this  option  is  not necessary.  If the [[u;;]latin1] and [[u;;]ascii] columns are identical, you are reading
              this page using this option or [[b;#fff;]man] did not format this page using the [[u;;]latin1] device description.
              If the [[u;;]latin1] column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This  option  is ignored when using options [[b;#fff;]-t], [[b;#fff;]-H], [[b;#fff;]-T], or [[b;#fff;]-Z] and may be useless for [[b;#fff;]nroff] other
              than [[b;#fff;]GNU's].

       [[b;#fff;]-E] [[u;;]encoding], [[b;#fff;]--encoding]=[[u;;]encoding]
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.   For  backward  compatibility,
              [[u;;]encoding]  may  be an [[b;#fff;]nroff] device such as [[b;#fff;]ascii], [[b;#fff;]latin1], or [[b;#fff;]utf8] as well as a true character en-
              coding such as [[b;#fff;]UTF-8].

       [[b;#fff;]--no-hyphenation], [[b;#fff;]--nh]
              Normally, [[b;#fff;]nroff] will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not  con-
              tain  hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out words on a line without excessive spacing.
              This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be  hyphenated  if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent [[b;#fff;]nroff] from hyphenating a word at an
              inappropriate point, do not use this option, but consult the [[b;#fff;]nroff]  documentation  instead;  for
              instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or
              put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       [[b;#fff;]--no-justification], [[b;#fff;]--nj]
              Normally, [[b;#fff;]nroff] will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full jus-
              tification, leaving justified only to the left margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If  you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent [[b;#fff;]nroff] from justifying certain para-
              graphs, do not use this option, but consult the [[b;#fff;]nroff] documentation instead; for  instance,  you
              can  use  the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill-
              ing.

       [[b;#fff;]-p] [[u;;]string], [[b;#fff;]--preprocessor=][[u;;]string]
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before [[b;#fff;]nroff] or [[b;#fff;]troff]/[[b;#fff;]groff].  Not all installations
              will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to desig-
              nate them are: [[b;#fff;]eqn] ([[b;#fff;]e]), [[b;#fff;]grap] ([[b;#fff;]g]), [[b;#fff;]pic] ([[b;#fff;]p]), [[b;#fff;]tbl] ([[b;#fff;]t]), [[b;#fff;]vgrind] ([[b;#fff;]v]), [[b;#fff;]refer] ([[b;#fff;]r]).   This  option  over-
              rides  the $[[b;#fff;]MANROFFSEQ] environment variable.  [[b;#fff;]zsoelim] is always run as the very first preproces-
              sor.

       [[b;#fff;]-t], [[b;#fff;]--troff]
              Use [[u;;]groff] [[u;;]-mandoc] to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in  conjunc-
              tion with [[b;#fff;]-H], [[b;#fff;]-T], or [[b;#fff;]-Z].

       [[b;#fff;]-T][[[u;;]device]], [[b;#fff;]--troff-device][=[[u;;]device]]
              This  option  is  used  to change [[b;#fff;]groff] (or possibly [[b;#fff;]troff's]) output to be suitable for a device
              other than the default.  It implies  [[b;#fff;]-t].   Examples  (provided  with  Groff-1.17)  include  [[b;#fff;]dvi],
              [[b;#fff;]latin1], [[b;#fff;]ps], [[b;#fff;]utf8], [[b;#fff;]X75] and [[b;#fff;]X100].

       [[b;#fff;]-H][[[u;;]browser]], [[b;#fff;]--html][=[[u;;]browser]]
              This  option  will  cause  [[b;#fff;]groff]  to  produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web
              browser.  The choice of browser is determined by the optional [[u;;]browser] argument if  one  is  pro-
              vided, by the $[[b;#fff;]BROWSER] environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usu-
              ally [[b;#fff;]lynx]).  This option implies [[b;#fff;]-t], and will only work with [[b;#fff;]GNU] [[b;#fff;]troff].

       [[b;#fff;]-X][[[u;;]dpi]], [[b;#fff;]--gxditview][=[[u;;]dpi]]
              This option displays the output of [[b;#fff;]groff] in a graphical window using the [[b;#fff;]gxditview] program.  The
              [[u;;]dpi]  (dots  per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a
              12-point base font.  This option implies [[b;#fff;]-T] with the X75, X75-12, X100, or  X100-12  device  re-
              spectively.

       [[b;#fff;]-Z], [[b;#fff;]--ditroff]
              [[b;#fff;]groff]  will  run [[b;#fff;]troff] and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for
              the chosen device.  If [[u;;]groff] [[u;;]-mandoc] is [[b;#fff;]groff], this option is passed to [[b;#fff;]groff] and will  suppress
              the use of a post-processor.  It implies [[b;#fff;]-t].

   [[b;#fff;]Getting] [[b;#fff;]help]
       [[b;#fff;]-?], [[b;#fff;]--help]
              Print a help message and exit.

       [[b;#fff;]--usage]
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       [[b;#fff;]-V], [[b;#fff;]--version]
              Display version information.

[[b;#fff;]EXIT] [[b;#fff;]STATUS]
       [[b;#fff;]0]      Successful program execution.

       [[b;#fff;]1]      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       [[b;#fff;]2]      Operational error.

       [[b;#fff;]3]      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       [[b;#fff;]16]     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

[[b;#fff;]ENVIRONMENT]
       [[b;#fff;]MANPATH]
              If $[[b;#fff;]MANPATH] is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       [[b;#fff;]MANROFFOPT]
              Every  time [[b;#fff;]man] invokes the formatter ([[b;#fff;]nroff], [[b;#fff;]troff], or [[b;#fff;]groff]), it adds the contents of $[[b;#fff;]MANROF-]
              [[b;#fff;]FOPT] to the formatter's command line.

       [[b;#fff;]MANROFFSEQ]
              If $[[b;#fff;]MANROFFSEQ] is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each man-
              ual page through.  The default preprocessor list is system dependent.

       [[b;#fff;]MANSECT]
              If  $[[b;#fff;]MANSECT] is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine
              which manual sections to search and in what order.  The default is "1 1p 8 2 3 3p 3pm 4 5 6 7  9
              0p  n  l  p  o  1x  2x  3x  4x  5x  6x  7x  8x",  unless  overridden by the [[b;#fff;]SECTION] directive in
              [[u;;]/etc/man][[b;#fff;]_][[u;;]db.conf].

       [[b;#fff;]MANPAGER], [[b;#fff;]PAGER]
              If $[[b;#fff;]MANPAGER] or $[[b;#fff;]PAGER] is set ($[[b;#fff;]MANPAGER] is used in preference), its value is used as  the  name
              of  the  program used to display the manual page.  By default, [[b;#fff;]less] is used, falling back to [[b;#fff;]cat]
              if [[b;#fff;]less] is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may  use  shell  quoting
              (backslashes,  single  quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple com-
              mands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either  as  an
              argument or on standard input.

       [[b;#fff;]MANLESS]
              If  $[[b;#fff;]MANLESS]  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the [[b;#fff;]less] pager, as
              if it had been passed using the [[b;#fff;]-r] option (so any occurrences of the text [[b;#fff;]$MAN_PN]  will  be  ex-
              panded  in  the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to
              "my prompt string", set $[[b;#fff;]MANLESS] to `[[b;#fff;]-Psmy] [[b;#fff;]prompt] [[b;#fff;]string]'.  Using the [[b;#fff;]-r] option  overrides  this
              environment variable.

       [[b;#fff;]BROWSER]
              If  $[[b;#fff;]BROWSER]  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is
              used to try to start a web browser for [[b;#fff;]man] [[b;#fff;]--html].  In each command, [[u;;]%s] is replaced by  a  file-
              name  containing the HTML output from [[b;#fff;]groff], [[u;;]%%] is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and [[u;;]%c]
              is replaced by a colon (:).

       [[b;#fff;]SYSTEM] If $[[b;#fff;]SYSTEM] is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the  argument  to
              the [[b;#fff;]-m] option.

       [[b;#fff;]MANOPT] If $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT] is set, it will be parsed prior to [[b;#fff;]man's] command line and is expected to be in a sim-
              ilar format.  As all of the other [[b;#fff;]man] specific environment variables can be expressed as command
              line  options,  and  are  thus candidates for being included in $[[b;#fff;]MANOPT] it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's  argu-
              ment must be escaped.

       [[b;#fff;]MANWIDTH]
              If  $[[b;#fff;]MANWIDTH] is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be for-
              matted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be formatted with a line length appropriate to  the
              current  terminal (using the value of $[[b;#fff;]COLUMNS], and [[b;#fff;]ioctl](2) if available, or falling back to 80
              characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the  default  formatting
              can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       [[b;#fff;]MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING]
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), format-
              ting characters are discarded to make it easier to read the result without special tools.   How-
              ever, if $[[b;#fff;]MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING] is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re-
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around [[b;#fff;]man] that can interpret formatting characters.

       [[b;#fff;]MAN_KEEP_STDERR]
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a  pager),  any  error  output
              from the command used to produce formatted versions of manual pages is discarded to avoid inter-
              fering with the pager's display.  Programs such as [[b;#fff;]groff] often produce  relatively  minor  error
              messages  about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally
              confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some users want to see them  any-
              way,  so,  if  $[[b;#fff;]MAN_KEEP_STDERR] is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       [[b;#fff;]LANG], [[b;#fff;]LC_MESSAGES]
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $[[b;#fff;]LANG] and $[[b;#fff;]LC_MESSAGES] will be  inter-
              rogated for the current message locale.  [[b;#fff;]man] will display its messages in that locale (if avail-
              able).  See [[b;#fff;]setlocale](3) for precise details.

[[b;#fff;]FILES]
       [[u;;]/etc/man][[b;#fff;]_][[u;;]db.conf]
              man-db configuration file.

       [[u;;]/usr/share/man]
